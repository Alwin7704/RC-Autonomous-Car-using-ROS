# RC-Autonomous-Car-using-ROS

This project implements an Autonomous RC Car using the Robot Operating System (ROS). The goal is to create a self-driving car capable of navigating through an environment and performing various tasks autonomously.

## Features

- **Perception**: The car uses various sensors, such as LiDAR and cameras, to perceive its surroundings and detect obstacles, traffic signs, and lane markings.

- **Localization**: It utilizes techniques like SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to estimate its position and map the environment in real-time.

- **Planning and Control**: The car plans its trajectory based on the perceived information and uses advanced control algorithms to drive autonomously, avoiding obstacles and following traffic rules.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- ROS Kinetic/Melodic/Noetic (depending on your system)
- Python 3
- Additional ROS packages (list any additional packages required)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alwin7704/RC-Autonomous-Car-using-ROS.git
